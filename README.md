\# 🔄 Notion → Slack Weekly Goals Automation



This project automates the process of turning \*\*Notion weekly goals\*\* into actionable tasks, syncing them back into Notion as individual tasks, and sending a \*\*Slack summary + direct messages to assignees\*\*.



---



\## ⚡ How It Works



1\. \*\*Trigger\*\* → New Goal created in Notion (Goals DB).

2\. \*\*AI by Zapier\*\* → Breaks down the goal into tasks, roles, and risks (structured JSON).

3\. \*\*Formatter\*\* → Converts arrays into clean text.

4\. \*\*Looping by Zapier\*\* → Iterates through tasks.

5\. \*\*Notion (Tasks DB)\*\* → Creates tasks with role, due date, source goal.

6\. \*\*Slack Channel\*\* → Posts a weekly summary message of all tasks and risks.

7\. \*\*Slack DM\*\* → Sends each assignee a private message with their assigned task.
